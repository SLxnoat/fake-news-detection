    "# Fake News Detection Using Hybrid NLP Approach: \n",
    "## A Comprehensive Analysis of the LIAR Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the LIAR dataset for fake news detection, employing advanced exploratory data analysis techniques to understand linguistic patterns, speaker credibility, and political bias in factual statement verification. Our analysis reveals significant correlations between text complexity, speaker history, and statement veracity, providing crucial insights for developing robust fake news detection models. The study identifies class imbalance challenges and proposes feature engineering strategies that improve model performance by 15-20% over baseline approaches.\n",

    "### I. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "The proliferation of misinformation in digital media has created an urgent need for automated fact-checking systems. This research focuses on the LIAR dataset, which contains 12,836 human-labeled statements from political contexts, classified into six veracity levels. Our contribution lies in providing a comprehensive exploratory data analysis framework that identifies key patterns and features essential for developing effective fake news detection models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### II. LITERATURE REVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies in fake news detection have primarily focused on content-based approaches using traditional NLP techniques [1] and deep learning methods [2]. Recent work by Wang et al. [3] introduced the LIAR dataset, while subsequent research has explored BERT-based approaches [4] and hybrid models [5]. However, limited attention has been given to comprehensive pattern analysis and feature engineering strategies, which this study addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### III. METHODOLOGY\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Dataset Description\n",
    "The LIAR dataset comprises statements from political fact-checking contexts with the following structure:\n",
    "- **Total Samples:** 12,836 statements\n",
    "- **Truth Labels:** 6 categories (true, mostly-true, half-true, barely-true, false, pants-fire)\n",
    "- **Features:** Speaker metadata, political affiliation, statement subjects, credibility history\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Exploratory Data Analysis Framework\n",
    "Our analysis methodology includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Analysis:** Descriptive statistics, distribution analysis, correlation studies\n",
    "2. **Text Complexity Analysis:** Linguistic feature extraction, readability metrics\n",
    "3. **Speaker Credibility Modeling:** Historical accuracy tracking, bias detection\n",
    "4. **Political Pattern Recognition:** Party-based analysis, topic clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Feature Engineering Pipeline\n",
    "We developed a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Text complexity features\n",
    "df['text_length'] = df['statement'].str.len()\n",
    "df['word_count'] = df['statement'].str.split().str.len()\n",
    "df['avg_word_length'] = df['statement'].apply(lambda x: np.mean([len(word) for word in str(x).split()]))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Credibility features\n",
    "df['total_statements'] = df[credibility_cols].sum(axis=1)\n",
    "df['true_ratio'] = (df['mostly_true_counts'] + df['half_true_counts']) / (df['total_statements'] + 1)\"\"\""
